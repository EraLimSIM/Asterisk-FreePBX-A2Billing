- When installing google voice module in Asterisk 13 you need to add two .so files to the loaded modules 
example: (mogit.so), you will see a module not loaded error when trying to setup the google voice trunk and it will
tell you the names of the two modules that needs to be loaded. Reboot and you are goo to go.

all 3 applications together using a single installer with the less possible user interaction.
